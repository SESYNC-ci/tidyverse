The pre-frontal convection also spawned one tornado.","A strong, warm and very wet Pacific weather system brought copious amounts of rainfall to Washington from November 2 through 7, with subsequent major flooding that extended through November 11.  This storm fueled in part from sub-tropical moisture associated with former western Pacific typhoon Cimaron, produced rain amounts of between 10 to 38 inches in the Cascades and Olympics and 4 to 10 inches in western Washington lowlands during this period. |Floods occurred at 34 forecast points on 25 rivers.  There were 22 locations with major flooding or greater.  There were 20 record floods.|Widespread and excessive urban and small stream flooding also occurred.|11 counties were declared disaster areas.  A tally had 104 homes destroyed, 206 homes with major damage, and 572 received minor damage.","A rare winter tornado outbreak occurred on December 29 over portions of North Texas, spawning almost two dozen tornadoes.  Very high shear and low instability created an environment favorable for tornadoes.  A strong surface low pressure system and warm front located in southern North Texas increased the probablitity for low-level rotation.  In addition to tornadoes, severe reports of large hail and flash flooding were widespread.","Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold frontal passage.","The combination of very deep tropical moisture with a slow-moving warm front and the approach of a strong upper level trough resulted in excessive rainfall across Harris and various surrounding counties. The ground became saturated on the 15th due to scattered convection before the more organized thunderstorms moved into the area shortly after midnight. These storms produced heavy rainfall due to their training nature. A brief break occurred during mid-day which allowed area creeks and bayous to recede before the onset of additional afternoon rainfall.

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.

Thunderstorms initiated over the deserts in the afternoon and then quickly moved westward over the mountains and towards the coast. An inverted V signature was noted above the 950 mb level on the 00Z KNKX sounding that afternoon, indicative of the potential for thunderstorms to produce microbursts. Three elderly fishermen drowned after their overloaded, 12-foot motorboat capsized on Lake Henshaw while trying to outrun an approaching thunderstorm. Eyewitness accounts and observations support the idea that this thunderstorm may have produced a minor, sub-severe microburst. This was probably all that was needed to capsize the small, overloaded boat. A friend of the fishermen was the first to notice the capsized boat, however he did not actually see the boat flip over. It is still not completely known if the boat capsized before or after the thunderstorm moved across the lake.","A logger was killed by lightning.","Thunderstorms formed along a cold front over much of South Central Texas and in advance of an upper level low moving eastward across New Mexico.","An upper low pressure system situated to the west brought large scale lift to north Texas.

Widespread flooding and wind damage followed, as well as a few tornadoes.","A few severe thunderstorms occurred over extreme southeast Colorado... producing damaging winds and large hail. One supercell generated large hail...damaging winds...and two tornadoes.  The tornado which struck Holly...rural northeast Prowers County...and rural southeast Kiowa County had a maximum rating of EF3.  The path width reached a maximum of around 900 yards in extreme northeast Prowers County.  Prior to this...as the tornado moved through Holly...the path width was around 600 feet.  Over 200 residences and other buildings were affected or destroyed.  Two people were killed and nine others were injured. The damage path was around 28 miles long...extending into Kiowa County.  The last substantial damage with the tornado was 12 miles north of Holly...in northeast Prowers County...where a ranch sustained high end EF3 damage.

One of these thunderstorms produced a significant tornado in Wilcox County.","Several severe thunderstorms impacted southern Missouri during the morning hours of March 1st.  A classic supercell moved from northern Arkansas and into Ozark and Howell counties.  This storm produced an EF-3 tornado that touched down southwest of Caulfield, Missouri, and tracked to areas southwest of West Plains, Missouri. One fatality occurred from this storm as the tornado ripped through a mobile home in rural Howell County.","An unusually early and intense outbreak of severe storms with large hail and tornadoes occurred across east central and southeast New Mexico during the afternoon and evening of the 23rd. The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.","Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a warm front over the Florida Panhandle and moved northeast across southeast Alabama and into extreme southwest Georgia during the afternoon hours of March 1.  The strongest tornado, classified an EF-4, killed nine and injured 50 in Enterprise, Alabama.","A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.

The worst flooding occurred along the Raritan and Passaic River Basins. It was the worst flooding in the Raritan Basin since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Bound Brook and Manville were once again hit hard as were communities on the other side of the Raritan River in Middlesex County. Along the Passaic Basin, Lincoln Park also was hit hard. The nor'easter also brought strong to high winds as well as some snow to the state on the 16th. Numerous streams and rivers flooded, but the flooding along the Delaware River was minimal.  |Statewide damage was estimated at $180 million dollars. It was the second worst rain storm (not related to a hurricane) in the state's history. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey declared a state of emergency on the 16th. About 5,000 people were evacuated in 11 of the state's 21 counties. At one time over 70 major roadways and interstates were closed including New Jersey State Routes 20, 23, 38, 46, 70 and 73 as well as U.S. Route 30 and Interstates 80 and 380. There were over 700 traffic accidents indirectly caused by the flooding and heavy rain. Three people in the state drowned. The strong winds caused about 120,000 homes and businesses in the state to lose power. Power was not completely restored until the 18th. The combination of the snow, wind (power outages) and flooding caused many school districts to either cancel classes or have delayed openings on the 16th. Even Rutgers University was closed on the 16th and 17th. In the Raritan Basin, school closings lasted into the week of April 23rd. The nor'easter was so nasty that even the Internal Revenue Service extended the tax deadline for 48 hours in affected areas. The heavy and flooding rains was expected to delay the spring planting on farms. Garden center and nursery business which was already slow because of the unseasonably cold weather was dealt another set-back. Twelve counties in the state were declared federal disaster areas and included Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris and Somerset Counties.   |Rain began falling throughout the area during the late evening on the 14th. It started briefly as snow over some of the higher terrain of Susse County. The rain fell at its heaviest from about 3 a.m. EDT on the 15th to about 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. As the upper air disturbance moved across New Jersey, the rain did change to snow for a couple of hours around sunrise on the 16th and accumulated about an inch or two on grassy areas in western New Jersey. The steady precipitation ended during the afternoon and early evening on the 16th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 6 inches. Event snowfall totals were an inch or two in most areas, mainly on grassy areas. |The strongest winds occurred as the nor'easter pulled northeast of the region on the 16th from the early morning into the afternoon. The combination of the heavy rain, even some snow and the winds helped knock down numerous trees and power lines. Peak wind gusts averaged between 40 and 60 mph.|The nor'easter low pressure system initially formed in the southern Rockies on the 12th and moved to Arkansas on the morning of the 14th. At 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, there were two low pressure systems, one in Kentucky and the other in western Alabama. The southern low pressure system became the predominate one overnight and at 8 a.m. EDT on the 15th, it (996 millibar low) was located in western North Carolina. As the 15th continued, it moved northeast and intensified rapidly. At 2 p.m. EDT the nor'easter (989 millibars) was near Raleigh, North Carolina. At 8 p.m. EDT, the nor'easter was a 979 millibar low pressure system near Virginia Beach, Virginia. Another low pressure system formed on its warm front during the afternoon over Chesapeake Bay and at 8 p.m. EDT it (982 millibars) was over extreme southwest New Jersey. The lows consolidated into one again overnight and a very intense 973 millibar low pressure system was located over Monmouth County, New Jersey at 2 a.m. EDT on the 16th. At 8 a.m. EDT on the 16th the nor'easter was down to 968 millibars and located over New York City. That was a drop in central pressure of 28 millibars in 24 hours which qualified it as a meteorological bomb (a drop in central pressure of at least 24 millibars in 24 hours) low pressure system. The nor'easter bottomed at a pressure of about 966 millibars (28.53 inches) at 11 a.m. EDT just south of Long Island, New York. To put into prospective how low the pressure was with this nor'easter, that central pressure is near the border of the pressure defined category 2 and category 3 hurricane once used on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the 16th continued, the nor'easter weakened and meandered across southwest New England and the New York and New Jersey coastal waters. By 2 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the nor'easter's central pressure rose to 988 millibars and a second storm formed on the triple point of its fronts south of Nova Scotia. This became the main low pressure system. The low pressure system then slowly moved southeast over the next couple of days. The heaviest precipitation fell as the low pressure system was rapidly intensifying on the 15th into the early part of the 16th. The strongest winds ceased after the low pressure system started to fill on the afternoon of the 16th.","An area of low pressure over the southeastern United States on the morning of Sunday, April 15th, rapidly intensified as it slowly moved north to near New York City by the morning of Monday, April 16th. This intense low in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced Overview: An area of low pressure intensified rapidly as it moved slowly from the southeastern United States on the morning of Sunday, April 15th to near New York City by the morning of Monday, April 16th.  The intense low over New York City in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced a very intense pressure gradient across the area which caused strong east to northeast winds to develop across the region.  Over land, the strong winds downed numerous trees.  The downed trees caused widespread power outages, especially near the coast, and numerous road closures.  Over the marine areas, the strong winds caused a storm surge and large ocean waves of up to 30 feet to develop.  The combination of astronomical high tides, storm surge, and large waves contributed to coastal flooding in coastal areas of the state and severe coastal erosion in areas south of Portland.|The storm also brought heavy rain to the region which, when combined with snow melt, produced widespread flooding across much of the region.  The flooding of small rivers and streams was worst in southern and coastal areas and led to numerous road closures.   In the mountains, the rain was preceded by heavy snow.  Flooding was minor on most mainstem rivers, however, in southern Maine, the Presumpscot River reached near record levels. |The intense low drifted very slowly eastward from Monday morning through Friday morning as it gradually weakened.  During this time, the pressure gradient slowly relaxed, the winds gradually diminished, and the seas slowly subsided.  However, rain continued into Tuesday across the region and each high tide during the period brought a reoccurrence of coastal flooding and erosion to the area.  Power outages persisted, and stream and river flooding continued across the region during this period.  Many roads remained closed.|On Friday, April 20, high pressure built eastward from the Great Lakes ending the influence of the Atlantic storm.  |  |Wind: The pressure gradient associated with the storm brought high winds to the region.  The damage observed in the hardest hit areas was typical of wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  While most observing sites reported winds below this range, topography, elevation, and exposure were likely factors in determining the amount of wind damage any location experienced.  In addition, the heavy rain brought strong wind gusts to the ground level and contributed to the sporadic nature of the heaviest wind damage.  In addition to the meteorological factors, damage from the wind was exacerbated because of the heavy rain that accompanied the wind and the soft, wet ground caused by the spring thaw.|The wind knocked over numerous trees and branches throughout the region and caused numerous and prolonged power outages throughout the region.| |Coastal Flooding/Storm Surge/Waves:  The coastal storm hit during a period of very high (and very low) astronomical tides.  In addition to the astronomical tides, the prolonged period of strong northeast winds caused a prolonged storm surge along the coastline.  Also during this period, the strong winds caused large and battering waves along the coast.  The storm tides and large waves caused significant flooding and coastal erosion. |In Portland, flood level is 12 feet.

Widespread major street flooding occurred throughout the afternoon across the eastern half of Harris county with SH 288 impassable near the 610 south loop, I-10 east closed at Wayside, and numerous secondary roads closed along I-45 S, SH 225, and I-10 E. Flooding of homes and businesses occurred in the La Porte area where some structures were inundated with more than a foot of water. House flooding also occurred in the Pasadena area. There were also at least a dozen schools that received water damage. Minor street flooding also occurred across portions of Galveston County in and around the League City area. There were three deaths from Erin. Two fatalities were from a supermarket roof collapse under the weight of the heavy rainfall, and the third fatality was from a vehicle that drove into a flooded detention pond.","Powerful and damaging thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois producing widespread wind damage.  The most intense wind damage occurred along a path which began in far western Dupage County near the intersection of Roosevelt Road and Washington Street in West Chicago and continued east through the northern portions Lombard and Glen Ellyn, into Northlake, then across the north side of Chicago to the Lake Michigan Shore near Montrose Harbor.  Wind damage along this path was consistent with winds 60 to 80 mph.  Smaller pockets of more intense damage with winds of 80 to 100 mph were noted in the Wrigleyville area.  The City of Chicago reported over 6,400 tree emergencies, over 200 damaged light poles, and over 350 downed power lines.  A 40 inch diameter tree was blown down on West Waveland Street in Chicago.

Tornadoes in Orleans Parish destroyed 32 houses and damaged 295 others.","Two very powerful storms with origins in the Tropics brought hazardous weather to the Pacific Northwest. The entire forecast area experienced heavy rainfall for an extended period of time. As an example of the extreme accumulations, over fourteen inches of rain fell at Lees Camp in the north Coast Range in a period of about 60 hours. This abnormally long period of consistently heavy rainfall led to widespread flooding, with the worst hit areas in the Coast Range and areas draining from the Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean. Five rivers in northwest Oregon surpassed major flood stages, fueling the extensive flood damage across the region.","An historic tornado outbreak rocked Northern Lower Michigan on the afternoon and evening of October 18th.  The day started out cool and rainy, but a dry slot aloft allowed sunshine to break out in the afternoon.  Temperatures rose into the lower to middle 70s in parts of the area.  The warm and humid air was unstable enough to fuel multiple rounds of thunderstorms in the late afternoon and evening hours.  There was a tremendous amount of shear in the atmosphere, and many storms quickly became supercells with rotating updrafts.  This was an environment conducive to tornadoes, as several lines of discrete supercells crossed Northern Lower Michigan.||Northern Lower Michigan had a record six tornadoes on the day.  The previous high was five, set on June 17 1992.  Unfortunately, the Kalkaska tornado produced a fatality.  That was the first tornado fatality in Northern Lower Michigan since March 30 1976, when a single death occurred in Ogemaw County.","A strong surface low and dryline interacted with a very unstable atmosphere over North Texas.

Other two-day totals included: 12.52 at the Cape Girardeau airport, 12.08 at Jackson, and 6.30 at Perryville. The rainfall at Cape Girardeau was the greatest single-day rainfall total on record. It contributed to the all-time wettest month at Cape Girardeau. The lowest amounts were near the Missouri Bootheel (in and near New Madrid), where around 4 inches fell. The Missouri National Guard was activated to assist with emergency operations in the hardest hit counties.","An unseasonable moist atmosphere and slow moving cold front set the stage for the training of rain and thunderstorms across much of northern Indiana. In addition, a dense snowpack rapidly melted as a result of the warm temperatures and rainfall, resulting in rapid rises on river and streams as well as widespread problems with flooding of low areas and ditches. Rainfall amounts ranging from a couple inches to locally over 7 inches was reported, with the highest amounts in and around White county.","Early on the 10th, there was widespread heavy rain in northern and western Arkansas. A weather system in Texas dragged a cold front toward the region, with a severe weather outbreak across Arkansas.","Lightning strike killed a woman at Sandbridge in Virginia Beach.","A series of vigorous upper-level disturbances were racing through a fast zonal flow across the southern states.  A supercell thunderstorm developed across north central Alabama and tracked southeast into northwest Georgia and eventually across downtown Atlanta, spawning an EF2 tornado that tracked right through the heart of downtown Atlanta.  This was the first recorded incident of a tornado touchdown in downtown Atlanta.  The tornado wreaked havoc on the downtown streets as it tracked from the Vine City neighborhood on the west, across the I-75/85 corridor, through the Cotton Mill Lofts, and into extreme western DeKalb county before weakening.  One death was reported and dozens were injured as they were trapped in downtown buildings amidst debris.  Damage was in the millions.","An elderly man drowned after driving into floodwaters while he was on his way to a doctor's appointment.  The 85 year old male was pulled from a flooded area near the Lost River.  His body was found about 70 feet away from his car in four and a half feet of water.  His death was ruled an accidental drowning.","Scattered thunderstorms moved through the Midlands and produced 1 to 2 inches of rain and some intense lightning.","Excessive rainfall developed over southern Missouri during the evening of 17 March.  A line of training convection assumed a position roughly along a line from Anderson to Ozark to Licking.  This convection expanded with time, eventually covering nearly all of extreme southeast Kansas and the Missouri Ozarks.  Moderate to heavy rain continued into the overnight period and did not stop until the morning of 19 March.","A powerful storm swept through all of California with high winds, periods of heavy rain, and locally heavy snow. Strong upslope flow off the Pacific and a high freezing level fueled larged amounts of rainfall on the coastal slopes. The snow level fell late in the storm as colder air filtered in resulting in heavy snowfall at elevations above 6000 feet. Isolated flash flooding and debris flows were reported, mainly in the burn areas. Flash flooding in the Inland Empire resulted in one death.","Very heavy rain began developing late on the 17th in northern and western Arkansas, and continued on the 18th as a powerful storm system approached from Texas. The system dredged copious moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and sent it toward Arkansas with a deep southerly wind flow. Well above normal precipitable water was noted, which enhanced rainfall efficiency across the region.","An upper level disturbance moved over the Mid South on the evening of March 31st and showers and thunderstorms developed across western Tennessee. Some of the stronger storms produced flash flooding.","Steady amounts of light to moderate rain caused streams and creeks to slowly rise out of their banks across much of extreme southeast Kansas and the Missouri Ozarks.  Widespread rainfall amounts from 3 March and 4 March ranged from one to four inches.  The greatest rainfall totals occurred over Taney, Ozark, Douglas, and Howell counties where significant flooding of secondary roads caused several school districts to cancel school on 4 March.","Low pressure crossed the Mid Atlantic March 8th, bringing a strong cold front through the region during the late afternoon and evening. This front triggered several strong to severe thunderstorms that produced large hail and gusty, damaging winds. There were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with several reports of trees falling into homes. One fatality was reported in Harford County when a tree fell onto a moving truck, killing the passenger.","The pattern that began to evolve on March 14th continued and intensified on March 15th.  A stationary front remained draped across north Georgia from near Atlanta to Athens.  South of this front, the air mass was becoming increasingly warm, moist and unstable.  Meanwhile, aloft, a low amplitude, yet vigorous short wave embedded within a fast zonal flow, was tracking rapidly eastward from the mid south into the southeast.  Strong shear and high helicity combined with the unstable air mass and the frontal boundary to allow repeated severe thunderstorms to develop and track eastward along the boundary across north Georgia.  The activity began early in the day as a complex of thunderstorms moved into the area from Alabama and continued until nearly midnight.  As the day progressed, especially during the afternoon, the development of the activity gradually progressed further south and by midnight had reached the south and southeast parts of the state.  Numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadic supercells were observed throughout the day.||Historical records indicate that this was one of the most significant severe weather days for the Peachtree City Weather Forecast Office with more events and warnings than had been observed since May 2003.","The pattern that began to evolve on March 14th continued and intensified on March 15th.

Large hail and damaging thunderstorm wind gusts were reported across portions of the region as well with isolated tornadoes reported across portions of Deep East Texas and west central Louisiana during the afternoon hours of March 30th.","Several waves of low pressure moved along a stationary front located across the Ohio Valley.  The waves of low pressure brought an extended period of heavy rain, with three to six inches of rainfall across southwest and central Ohio.","Storms developed along a dry line which moved into north Texas during the afternoon hours on the 18th.  Rich Gulf moisture and ample instability helped the storms develop further as they encountered a warm front to the east.  At least one tornado touched down and more than a thousand flights were cancelled at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport as numerous storms moved through the metroplex.","Isolated severe thunderstorms and thunderstorms with heavy rain, which resulted in flash flooding, occurred on March 18. This event damaged many county roads and bridges across northwestern Arkansas and combined with previous damages, resulted in a Disaster Declaration for Benton, Carroll, Washington, Madison, Crawford, and Franklin Counties.","A powerful cold front moved rapidly southeast across southwest Indiana during the late afternoon hours. An organized line of severe thunderstorms developed along the front as it approached southern Illinois, then swept east across southwest Indiana. Widespread damaging winds accompanied the line of storms. Temperatures fell about 30 degrees in less than one hour when the very strong cold front passed through.","A stalled front resided across the Mid Atlantic during the afternoon and evening of June 4th, allowing moisture and instability to pool along the boundary. This combined with several strong upper level disturbances resulted in numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon and evening. Many of these thunderstorms became severe. While penny sized was reported in spots, damaging winds from the thunderstorms was widespread. EF-1 tornadoes were confirmed near Stevensville in Culpeper County, in Millwood in Clarke County and near Hartwood in Stafford County.","Severe thunderstorms developed along a stalled frontal boundary across the Ohio Valley with widespread wind damage across eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and Garrett county Maryland. One fatality occurred in Westmoreland county Pennsylvania when a large tree fell on a moving car, killing the driver.","Rain spread into southeast Ohio near dawn on Tuesday, the 18th.  A strong east to west warm front had set up across northern Kentucky.  By late afternoon, rain amounts of 0.5 to 1.35 had already fallen, with the heaviest being over northern Jackson, Vinton, and Athens Counties.  A lull occurred Tuesday evening, as the warm front and its rain shifted north.  However, as the low pressure lifted northeast through the Ohio Valley, another 1 to 2 inches of rain fell on the 19th.

Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.","Scattered thunderstorms brought locally heavy rainfall and hail to the region.","Excessive rainfall during the month of March into the beginning of April brought rivers and their tributaries to high levels. Some rivers came out their banks and flooded many roadways. A few deaths as a result of the flooding.","Excessive rainfall during the month of March into the beginning of April brought rivers and their tributaries to high levels. Some rivers came out their banks and flooded several roadways and a few homes. A few deaths occurred as a result of the flooding as well.","Repeated development of storms along and north of an advancing warm front led to a large swath of greater than three inches of rain south of a line from Stockton to West Plains.  This excessive rain occurred on wet soil conditions from record rainfall in February and March.  Nearly 100 reports of flash flooding were received between midnight and 11 am on the 10th.  Two fatalities occurred from this episode of dangerous flash flooding.  Record flooding occurred along Lake Taneycomo as high releases from Table Rock Lake Dam flooded all lowlands along Taneycomo, including numerous frame and mobile homes.  The Core of Engineers released 46,500 cubic feet per second, which was an all time high.  The lake crested at 933.25 feet above sea level, which was a record level.  Due to an unusually high water table along with saturated soil conditions, all counties within the NWS Springfield County Warning Area experienced widespread flooding on nearly all secondary roads.  Emergency Management Directors across the region that were responsible for baracading roads, stated that as little as one half of an inch of rain was causing widespread road closures across their county of interest.","A warm front moved slowly north across western Kentucky during the afternoon. Large clusters of thunderstorms produced very heavy rain. A cold front moved southeast into the Lower Ohio Valley during the night, preceded by more thunderstorms. These storms produced a report of wind damage and a tornado. Rainfall for the 24-hour period ranged from 2 to 4 inches across most of western Kentucky, with isolated amounts of 4 to 7 inches. The isolated higher amounts were mostly from Madisonville to Marion.","Repeated development of storms along and north of an advancing warm front led to a large swath of greater than three inches of rain south of a line from Stockton to West Plains.

Ahead of the system, breezy southerly winds provided well above normal temperatures and abundant moisture. Warmth and moisture destabilized the atmosphere and fueled developing thunderstorms. A cold front moved across the state causing numerous severe storms and several tornadoes. One of the tornadoes tracked from Yell County to Sharp County, staying on the ground for 121.84 miles. This track length set a record for the longest tornado path ever recorded in Arkansas. The continuous track was confirmed by two National Weather Service meteorologists who flew the track with the Civil Air Patrol. The final track was based on ground surveys, the Civil Air Patrol flight, and an aerial mapping flight performed for the Arkansas Forestry Commission.","Two long lived supercells wreaked havoc across portions of north central and northeast Kansas on the night of June 11th. Three significant tornadoes touched down, caused millions of dollars in damage, killed two, and critically injured three citizens. The town of Chapman saw the most extensive damage.  Approximately three-quarters of the town were damaged by the tornado that passed through. Numerous homes were demolished, as were both the middle school and high school. One death occured, as a result of a tree having fallen onto a young woman oustide her car, who had just placed her daughter into her car seat. The most severe, but more localized damage occurred in the Miller Ranch neighborhood in Manhattan, where several homes were completely destroyed. The Soldier, Kansas tornado was responsible for the other death. A man was killed in his mobile home when it flipped several times and was found a few miles from it's original location.  The unoccupied home a few hundred feet from the mobile home went virtually untouched. Thousands of citizens turned up over the next few weeks to help with the clean-up effort in both Chapman and Manhattan.","A warm front lifted north over the Midsouth during the late evening hours of April 3, 2008.

Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.","Low pressure developed over Kansas with a strong southerly flow of very moist air streaming into Iowa ahead of it.

The Great Flood of June 2008 was one of Indiana's costliest natural disasters.  Major roads and interstates flooded.  Heavy rainfall on May 30th allowed streams and rivers to rise.  Additional heavy rainfall on the 3rd and the 4th added to these high levels.  Severe weather brought heavy rainfall on the 6th as well.  The stage was set for historic flooding in portions of central and southern Indiana.  The storms on the 6th exacerbated the situation by laying down a boundary in southern Illinois and southern Indiana.  A moist southerly low level jet rode over this boundary for more than 12 hours continually generating showers and thunderstorms.  Rainfall of two to nearly eleven inches fell across portions of central and southern Indiana.  The impact of the rain was immediate with widespread flash flooding occurring.","Massive and historic flash flooding struck central Indiana.

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).||The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.||The Rock River crested at all-time record high levels at the following gauage sites:  Waupun (10.07' on 6/13), Horicon (10.29' on 6/17), Watertown (7.81' on 6/13), Jefferson (15.64' on 6/18), Ft. Atkinson (10.85' on 6/21), Newville (15.12' on 6/21), Indianford (18.33' on 6/21), and Afton (13.51' on 6/21).  Likewise, the Crawfish River set a new all-time high crest of 13.59' on 6/16 at Milford, and Beaver Dam Creek set a new record of 843.53' on 6/16 at Beaver Dam.  Other, new, all-time record high crests include 4.47' on 6/9 on the Bark River at Rome, 4.95' on 6/13 on the Mukwonago River at Mukwonago, 11.41' on 6/8 on Oak Creek in South Milwaukee, 13.93' on 6/13 on the Milwaukee River near Cedarburg, 13.54' on 6/15 on the Fox River at Burlington, and 15.18' on 6/15 on the Fox River at New Munster.||High water levels generaged major road blocks, for various periods, on Interstate 94 in Jefferson and Waukesha Counties, on Interstate 894 in Milwaukee, and on Interstate 39/90/94 in Columbia County near Portage.  Most inland lakes rose to high levels that resulted in minor shoreline damage to piers, etc.","Two long lived supercells wreaked havoc across portions of north central and northeast Kansas on the night of June 11th. Three significant tornadoes touched down, caused millions of dollars in damage, killed two, and critically injured three citizens. The town of Chapman saw the most extensive damage.  Approximately three-quarters of the town were damaged by the tornado that passed through. Numerous homes were demolished, as were both the middle school and high school. One death occured, as a result of a tree having fallen onto a young woman oustide her car, who had just placed her daughter into her car seat. The most severe, but more localized damage occurred in the Miller Ranch neighborhood in Manhattan, where several homes were completely destroyed. The Soldier, Kansas tornado was responsible for the other death. A man was killed in his mobile home when it flipped several times and was found a few miles from it's original location.  The unoccupied home a few hundred feet from the mobile home went virtually untouched. Thousands of citizens turned up over the next few weeks to help with the clean-up effort in both Chapman and Manhattan.","Massive and historic flash flooding struck central Indiana.  The Great Flood of June 2008 was one of Indiana's costliest natural disasters.  Major roads and interstates flooded.  Heavy rainfall on May 30th allowed streams and rivers to rise.  Additional heavy rainfall on the 3rd and the 4th added to these high levels.  Severe weather brought heavy rainfall on the 6th as well.  The stage was set for historic flooding in portions of central and southern Indiana.  The storms on the 6th exacerbated the situation by laying down a boundary in southern Illinois and southern Indiana.  A moist southerly low level jet rode over this boundary for more than 12 hours continually generating showers and thunderstorms.  Rainfall of two to nearly eleven inches fell across portions of central and southern Indiana.  The impact of the rain was immediate with widespread flash flooding occurring.","A slow moving cold front provided a focus for severe thunderstorms.  These thunderstorms produced very heavy rain that resulted in flash flooding, hail, and damaging winds.","Steep mid level lapse rates provided enough instability for showers and thunderstorms to develop across interior Massachusetts.  Some of these thunderstorms became severe, producing damaging wind gusts.  One of these storms produced winds that broke limbs off trees, including one that struck an 81 year old woman hard enough that she subsequently died.","A warm frontal boundary across from eastern North Dakota to central Minnesota was one of the main culprits for severe weather on this date.","Heavy rain caused dangerous flash flooding and flooding across many locations in central Indiana.  A weak tornado also touched down in Greene County.","A slow moving cold front helped trigger scattered showers and thunderstorns across eastern Pennsylvania during the afternoon and evening of the 14th. Because of the hot and humid air mass preceding this front, some of the storms became severe.","Very warm and more humid air became established across the region by midday on the 26th. Low pressure was located well north of the area in Ontario, and another trough of low pressure was swinging southeast from Michigan. Showers and thunderstorms developed during the afternoon and continued through late evening. With increased moisture across the region, some of the thunderstorms not only became severe, but also caused some flash flooding across the area.","Former hurricane Dolly brought tropical moisture into New Mexico, dumping up to seven inches of rain around Ruidoso. This caused the Rio Ruidoso and Rio Bonito to rise well above flood stage and resulted in widespread and serious flooding around Ruidoso.","Strong warm air advection took place across Iowa during the overnight hours of the 10th into the morning of the 11th.  CAPE increased to over 3000 J/kg as the lifted index fell to around -7.  A strong low level jet of 50 to 60 kts was in place over the state.  Thunderstorms formed initially over Kansas, then spread northeast into western Iowa.  A wind gust of 65 MPH occurred in Bedford as the storms passed.  Mainly, the storms produced very heavy rainfall. In Taylor County, an inch of rain fell in 30 minutes at Gravity.  For the most part, the storms produced wind gusts of 30 to 45 MPH and pea to marble size hail.  Flash flooding occurred in Crawford County as heavy rains caused the water to rise over the top of U.S. Highway 30.  Rainfall of nearly 2 inches in less than an hour caused flash flooding in Bedford.  Lightning struck a 20 year old male that was working with his father in their yard, killing him.","A powerful weather system moved through central Indiana on the night of June 3rd.  Associated with this system were damaging straight line thunderstorm winds and tornadoes.  Three tornadoes developed from supercells.  An EF-1 tornado moved through Decatur County, an EF-2 tornado moved through Brown and Johnson Counties, and then weakened to an EF-1 in Shelby County, and another tornado began as an EF-0 in Shelby County and intensified to an EF-3 in Rush County.","Severe thunderstorms produced hail and wind damage across central Indiana from mid-afternoon through early evening.","NWS storm survey teams determined that one EF1 tornado struck Osceola county.  Another EF1 tornado struck Eaton county and continued into extreme western Ingham county before dissipating. Extensive damage was documented in association with both tornadoes.  Severe thunderstorms also produced numerous reports of wind damage and large hail.","Isolated thunderstorms developed in an unstable atmosphere.","A shepherd and a mule were killed by lightning at the headwaters of Oso Creek near the Continental Divide.","A boy was struck and killed by lightning near a youth camp in Custer County.  He was riding a bicycle with others.","Two graduate students at Colorado State University were struck by lightning while standing under a tree.  One man was killed instantly, the other died of his injuries a week later.","A deep tap of subtropical moisture combined with a weak disturbance aloft to produce heavy rain over Gallup, resulting in flash flooding in the downtown area.","Several lightning strikes occurred across the western Florida Panhandle during the afternoon.","Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front during the evening, producing wind damage and localized flooding.","On July 24th a closed 500 mb low was digging over NY/PA and waves of surface low pressure were riding north along the associated surface front to the west of the forecast area. A strong 50kt low level jet was also riding northward ahead of the front. This resulted in extremely high helicity values across southern and central New Hampshire. A surface dew point boundary was in place across south central New Hampshire with readings in the lower 70s to the east of this boundary and in the mid 60s to the west. Sunshine began breaking out to the east of this boundary by mid morning and convection began developing by late morning. Storms grew rapidly and quickly began rotating. A tornado rated as strong as F2 cut a 50 mile path through 5 counties in southeast New Hampshire resulting in 1 fatality and damage to over 100 structures some of which were completely destroyed.","Weak upper level disturbances interacted with a moist airmass to produce afternoon thunderstorms.","A nearly stationary frontal boundary remained just west of the area producing afternoon and evening thunderstorms.","Slow moving thunderstorms developed in a very moist environment across Southeast Arizona resulting in areas of flash flooding.","A mesoscale convective system developed across Southeast Arizona resulting in heavy rainfall and flash flooding.","This episode was the 2nd round of severe storms over southern Wisconsin on July 7th.  A line of storms moved west to east across southern Wisconsin during the evening hours.  Powerful thunderstorm downburst winds were generated which knocked down trees and power-lines that left about 23,000 customers without electrical power.  Additionally, one isolated tornado spun up on the leading edge of the line of storms in southern Green Lake County, where a microburst pushed ahead and enhanced local vorticiy/rotation in a storm cell.  The storms were associated with a short-wave trough at 500 MB moving east through Wisconsin, with a 30 knot low-level jet at 850 MB.  Surface temperatures were in the 80s and surface dewpoints werer around 70.","A severe thunderstorm clipped far northern portions of Campbell and Crook Counties with hail to golf ball size and heavy rain. Three to six inches of rain fell from near Weston to the Wyoming/Montana border.","A very strong and unseasonably cold upper level low pressure system that was tracking across the northern plains brought a strong low level jet to the region during the early morning hours of June 11th.  The warm and unstable air that worked north into the region helped spawn early morning severe thunderstorms across eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa.  Later that day as the upper level system worked into the central Dakotas, a cold front pushed across the region.  This helped set off another round of thunderstorms that developed over east central Nebraska by late afternoon.||Isolated small supercell thunderstorms initially developed ahead of the cold front over eastern Nebraska, but they were quickly overtaken by a broken line of larger supercell thunderstorms, some of the heavy precipitation type, that developed along the cold front.  Cell mergers and training were observed well into the evening hours as the activity quickly spread across southwest Iowa.  The storms produced a total of 8 confirmed tornadoes in the Omaha/Valley warning area which covers eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa.","A strong cold frontal passage triggered severe thunderstorms across New Jersey on the afternoon of the 27th.","Lightning struck a house on a barrier island south of Topsail Beach.","A pre-frontal trough well ahead of a cold front moved into a sultry airmass with ample instability and wind shear. A weak supercell formed near Erie, Pennsylvania and grew as it encountered an outflow from earlier convection. The storm continued to intensify as it moved across the western southern tier of New York and reach severe limits as it cross the eastern Finger Lakes and eastern Lake Ontario Regions of New York. The thunderstorms produced hail up to three-quarter inch in diameter and wind gusts were estimated to near 70 mph. The storms cut power to nearly 75,000 customers for several hours through the evening. Falling trees damaged homes and automobiles in Avon and York, Livingston county and Phoenix, Oswego and Sandy Pond in Oswego county. Oswego County was particularly hard hit. In Sandy Creek, between 500 and 600 trees were downed at the Elms Golf Club. The utilities reported about 100 power poles downed by the storms. Two funnels were spotted???one in Cayuga County and one in Jefferson County however no touchdown occurred in either case. One death occurred with the storms. In the town of Croghan, a 47-year-old logger was crushed by a falling tree.","Deep subtropical moisture brought heavy rain to the Santa Fe area, resulting in flash flooding on the northeast side of town as arroyos became torrents and streets flooded.  Locations affected include Morales Bridge, Circle Drive, Lorenzo Road and Cerro Gordo Road. One fatality occurred in this flash flood.","Severe thunderstorms occurred during the early morning hours on the 2nd.","Outflow winds from a thunderstorm caused damage to several trees and knocked down power lines.","Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall and flash flooding developed across Southeast Arizona. These storms primarily impacted Graham, Cochise and Pima Counties.","Thunderstorms and very heavy rain resulted in flooded low spots and highway dips near Bouse. Centennial wash near Wenden was flooded and gauges recorded a flow of 6,000 cubic feet per second with a stage near 4 feet.","A stationary front was draped across north Georgia early on May 10th with an active northwest flow aloft.  Meanwhile...a vigorous short wave aloft was approaching the area from the southern plains.  The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.  The strong winds combined with wet ground resulted in dozens of trees being blown down in some north Georgia counties.  There were also two deaths as a result of downed trees in Barrow and Gwinnett county, all non-thunderstorm-related winds.","A line of severe thunderstorms moved into north central Kansas early the morning of the 24th. Hail to the size of half dollars fell, and winds to 70 mph were reported across the region. Minor damage was reported, mainly to tree limbs, power lines, and some structures. One home had it's roof partially torn off, and it's carport destroyed.","An area of low pressure, and an accompanying cold front, approached from the west and collided with an air mass that was much more humid than normal for early fall.","During the three day period of September 21-23, 2008, parts of Puerto Rico suffered from one of the most catastrophic flooding events of the season to date. The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo???s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco???s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.","An area of slow moving showers and thunderstorms produced up to 6 inches of rain in 3 hours resulting in flash flooding on Ames Brook in Ashland which rose rapidly and flooded the Ames Brook Campground. A family trying to escape the flooded campground drove over a bridge on the brook just as it was washed away. Tragically a 7 year old girl was killed and her mother and brother were injured. In addition many roads were flooded or washed out in other areas of town. Dozens of residents had to be evacuated along Elm Street and surrounding streets in Ashland during the event.","Elevated severe thunderstorms containing large hail developed north of a warm front that was moving slowly northward across eastern Oklahoma and west central Arkansas during the morning and early afternoon of the 10th. ||Another round of severe thunderstorms developed late in the afternoon as a dry line approached the area from the west. Extreme instability and strong vertical wind shear resulted in the development of long-lived supercell thunderstorms that moved across eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas during the late afternoon and evening. Several of these supercells became tornadic and a few produced long-lived damaging tornadoes. ||One such supercell developed and moved along the Oklahoma-Kansas border and then into southwestern Missouri. This storm produced a tornado in northeastern Craig County OK that remained on the ground for 29 miles in Oklahoma, continued for about 31 miles in Newton County MO, and finally dissipated about 15 miles into Barry County MO. It produced EF-4 damage in several locations, including Picher, a small town in north-central Ottawa County OK. Twenty-one fatalities, over 350 injuries, and an estimated $60 million in property damage resulted from this tornado in Oklahoma and Missouri. Six of the fatalities and about 150 injuries occurred in Picher OK.||Other strong tornadoes developed and moved across portions of Pittsburg and Latimer Counties. A EF-2 tornado was on the ground for about eight miles west of McAlester, damaging numerous homes in its path. Another EF-2 tornado developed southwest of Hartshorne in Pittsburg County and moved 19 miles before dissipating just east of Yanush in Latimer County. Four injuries resulted from that tornado and numerous homes were severely damaged or destroyed.","During the three day period of September 21-23, 2008, parts of Puerto Rico suffered from one of the most catastrophic flooding events of the season to date.

Fifty-five tornadoes were documented during that afternoon and evening!  Some of the tornadoes were very large and damaging.  The character of the supercell thunderstorms that day had similarities to the storms that produced the Greensburg tornado a little over a year after.  In fact there was one tornado that was just as large and perhaps could have been just as damaging that was headed towards the small Kiowa county town but fortunately turned and dissipated.","During the three day period of September 21-23, 2008, parts of Puerto Rico suffered from one of the most catastrophic flooding events of the season to date.

Farmers also reported extensive damage to crops and irrigation equipment.  ||There was one fatality, and 78 injuries ranging from broken bones to minor cuts and lacerations.  One man was killed when he tried to escape a trailer park in his motor home.  Tractor trailers were flipped along U.S. Highway 85, and over 200 power poles were snapped or blown down. Approximately 60,000 people were left without electricity.  The tornado overturned 15 railroad cars and destroyed a lumber car on the Great Western Railway of Colorado.  The tornado also flattened Windsor's main feedlot and destroyed a dairy barn.  Most of the four-hundred cows were killed in the tornado or destroyed later. In addition to the damaging winds, the thunderstorm also produced hail up to the size of baseballs.  ||Another tornado rated an EF1, from a separate severe thunderstorm, briefly touched down near Dacono and destroyed 5 buildings. The tornado overturned a five-wheel trailer and injured the man who was sitting inside.  ||Preliminary estimates from FEMA indicated 850 homes were damaged, and nearly 300 homes were significantly damaged or destroyed.  The Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association reported $1 million of damage to electric transmission lines.  Privately insured damages totaled $147 million, making it the state's 4th costliest disaster.","A powerful cold front sparked a lengthy squall line that crossed all of southern Indiana on the evening of January 29. A large number of locations had 60 to as much as 100 mph winds, causing extensive property damage.  There were also a few small tornado spin-ups, one of which caused a fatality when a tree fell onto a mobile home near Henryville, Indiana.","A warm front moved across northern Illinois during the morning hours of September 13th as the remnants of tropical storm Lowell moved across the region.  These two features combined to produce heavy rain and flash flooding across many areas of northern Illinois.","While the upper low to the northeast of Georgia, across the mid-Atlantic was weakening, a weak upper trough lingered across this region.  This combined with typical July heat and humidity was more than adequate for another afternoon of significant pulse thunderstorms, several of which became severe.  The activity lingered into the early morning hours of the 9th.  There was even one fatality in Banks county in northeast Georgia when a tree fell on a house.  The slow movement and clustering of thunderstorms across north central Georgia in Forsyth, Dawson, and Lumpkin counties prompted flash flood warnings.  A minor flash flood event was observed in Dawson county.","The extreme outer bands of Tropical Storm Hanna impacted Puerto Rio during the first week of September. Hanna's circulation induced a low level flow of south to southwest winds that pushed showers and thunderstorms from the Caribbean waters northward into the island. Rainfall amounts of 10-12 inches were recorded in some areas over a 24 hour period ending on Wednesday September 3. Many rivers were reported out of their banks, numerous landslides were reported. Flooded streets and closed roads, strong gusty winds and isolated tornadoes were also registered. People were put in shelters along the western municipality  of Anasco due to flooding. Hanna's center, at its closest point to Puerto Rico on September 3, 2008, the day when the islands were most affected by the storm, was nearly 350 miles away to the west northwest.","Heavy rain fell across northwest Indiana which caused significant flooding.","Tropical Storm Hanna came ashore near the NC/SC border, with winds over 40 mph and heavy rain. Rainfall amounts averaged between four and six inches. There were multiple road closures in Horry county, due to the heavy rain and minor storm surge. The saturated soil contributed to numerous downed trees.","Flash flooding occurred in a very narrow slot canyon in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.","The remnants of hurricane Ike moved across northwest Indiana during the morning hours of September 14th.  This system produced a second round of very heavy rain after a period of heavy rain just 24 hours earlier across many of the same areas.  Flash flooding was common as many creeks, streams and rivers swelled over their banks, some reaching all-time high record crests.  Flooding was extensive and widespread with some of the worse flooding located near streams and rivers.  Storm total rainfall amounts for September 13th and September 14th (combined) included, 11.02 inches near Valparaiso, 10.69 inches in Porter, 10.59 inches in Chesterton, 10.41 inches in Lakes of the Four Seasons, 9.37 inches in Merrilliville, 9.04 inches in Crown Point, 8.95 inches near Hammond, 8.31 inches in Hebron, 7.61 inches in Whiting, 7.43 inches in De Motte, 6.86 inches in Munster, 6.16 inches near Wheatfield, 5.85 inches in Rensselaer and 5.85 inches in Kentland.","A warm front moved across northern Illinois during the morning hours of September 13th as the remnants of tropical storm Lowell moved across the region.  These two features combined to produce heavy rain and flash flooding across many areas of northern Illinois.","A large upper trough with a closed upper low slowly moved east across the Central United States March 17th through the 19th. This allowed a strong southerly flow to transport copious amounts of moisture from the deep south into the Midwest.  Several waves of low pressure moved along a nearly stationary frontal boundary that remained just south of the forecast area, across northern Arkansas and extreme southern Illinois. Several rounds of rain and thunderstorms brought locally heavy rainfall to much of the forecast area, with the greatest amounts confined along and south of Interstate 44 in Missouri and Interstate 70 in Illinois. Total rainfall ranged from less than an inch across portions of west central Illinois to almost 10 inches in southern Reynolds County, Missouri. The excessive rainfall led to flash flooding of low lying areas and major flooding on local rivers and creeks for the next week. Many people were affected by this event, with millions of dollars in damage recorded across the forecast area.","Moisture plume from the Southwest United States spread northeast towards the plains and interacted with a stationary boundary to produce a deluge of rainfall across Central and South Central Kansas.  Rainfall amounts were generally around 5 inches, however isolated amounts reached up to 11.00 inches on the West side of Wichita, Kansas.  Wichita Mid Continent Airport reported the greatest 24 rainfall total (10.31 inches) in its history.","A cold front was the catalyst for numerous reports of severe weather on this date.","A cold front moved through the region and interacted with the remnants of Hurricane Ike.  Widespread heavy rain was reported across Missouri and Illinois causing major flooding across the region.  Many small creeks in the St. Louis Metropolitan area that had not flooded for years became raging rivers flooding roads, homes and businesses. Also, winds from the remnants of Hurricane Ike caused tree, power line and building damage in some locations.","A cold front moved through the region and interacted with the remnants of Hurricane Ike.

Also, winds from the remnants of Hurricane Ike caused tree, power line and building damage in some locations.","Hurricane Gustav caused wind damage, flash flooding, and several tornadoes across southwest Louisiana.||Hustav made landfall in Terrebonne Parish in the morning of September 2nd as a category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph.||Gustav moved northwest, almost up along Highway 90 across St. Mary, Iberia, St. Martin, and Lafayette Parishes. The highest measured wind gusts were 85 mph at a research site near Abbeville, LA in Vermilion Parish. However, wind speeds were estimated between 75 and 85 mph from St. Mary Parish to Evangeline Parish.||Storm surge was a minimal impact because southwest Louisiana was on the west side of the onshore winds for most of the event. The highest recorded storm tide was 4.77 at Amerada Pass in St. Mary Parish.||However, rainfall was a large impact. In central Louisiana, over 20 inches of rain fell in Rapides Parish, with a CO-OP observer recording 20.43 inches 7 miles east of Alexandria. This resulted in widespread flooding of the Alexandria-Pineville region, where over 200 water rescues were performed. Significant flooding also occurred in New Iberia, where over ten inches of rain fell, resulting in widespread flooding in and around New Iberia.||Several tornadoes were seen across southwest Louisiana, with the worst one occurring in Evangeline Parish near Mamou, where two people were killed when their tied-down mobile home was thrown for over 200 yards.||Other fatalities in the region were considered indirect. Two men died in Calcasieu Parish from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running in their home. A woman died in St. Martin Parish when her home caught fire from burning candles after she lost power.||Total property damages were estimated near 750 million dollars in southwest Louisiana. Agricultural loses were estimated to be over 225 million dollars.","An advancing cold front moving through the state caused widespread wind damage and a few tornadoes across Central Alabama, especially in the eastern half of the state.","Moisture plume from the Southwest United States spread northeast towards the plains and interacted with a stationary boundary to produce a deluge of rainfall across Central and South Central Kansas.  Rainfall amounts were generally around 5 inches, however isolated amounts reached up to 11.00 inches on the West side of Wichita, Kansas.  Wichita Mid Continent Airport reported the greatest 24 rainfall total (10.31 inches) in its history.","Two men participating in a race to benefit United Celebral Palsy were lost at sea after they left the Richardson Bay Marina in San Francisco Bay around 9am aboard a 32 foot boat named Daisy on Saturday March 15th. Around 1030am Sunday morning March 16th, officials recovered debris from the boat about 5 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge. An hour later, the body of one of the sailors was found. The other body has not been recovered.","A sea breeze boundary, combined with a shortwave trough, fired off strong thunderstorms that pushed off the coast of North Carolina.","A low pressure system, which was tracking eastward, was centered over the Illinois/Indiana border during the early morning hours of May 11th. A secondary low pressure system began to develop over eastern North Carolina during the late afternoon on the 11th. As this storm intensified and became more organized, the earlier storm to the west weakened considerably. The main storm began to slowly track up the Middle Atlantic coastline late on the 11th into the 12th, however it rapidly intensified over far southeastern Maryland. During the early morning hours of the 12th, the storm was centered over the southern Delmarva with yet another low forming offshore. With the two lows in close proximity, one of which was rather potent, a strong northeast wind developed and persisted through the evening of the 12th. The prolonged northeast flow combined with higher than normal tides caused tidal flooding in Delaware. There was limited moisture further inland from the center of the system but an abundance of moisture was ushered into portions of Delaware. By the evening of the 12th, what was named the Mother???s Day Nor???easter of 2008, began moving away from the region, which brought an end to the strong winds and tidal flooding problems.||The potent storm, which generated very strong winds and high seas, broke apart a research vessel named Russell W. Peterson, 14 miles off the coast of Rehoboth Beach. The U.S. Coast Guard rescued two crew members from the sea within three hours of getting the distress signal (7:56 AM EDT on the 12th). By 10:30 AM EDT, a Coast Guard rescue team had the two crew members aboard the helicopter. The pair was rescued in high seas by a U.S. Coast Guard rescue squad and hoisted from the ocean by a helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey. One of the victims did not have vital signs upon arrival at a Salisbury, Maryland hospital, and later died. The vessel itself ran ashore in Bethany Beach due to the strong winds and higher tides.","Scattered severe thunderstorms produced gusty winds over portions of the Chesapeake Bay and Maryland and Virginia Coastal Waters.","Strong winds and high seas contributed to a man falling off a shrimp boat.","Strong west winds gusting in excess of 30 knots at times whipped up high waves over Grand Traverse Bay on Lake Superior on the 23rd. The high waves  sank a 16-foot fishing boat which claimed the life of a Laurium man.","Gusty northwest winds, of up to 20 knots behind a departing cold front, caused a catamaran to capsize in Western Long Island Sound, near Westport. A 3 year old occupant of the boat drowned in the accident."],null,{"showCoverageOnHover":true,"zoomToBoundsOnClick":true,"spiderfyOnMaxZoom":true,"removeOutsideVisibleBounds":true,"spiderLegPolylineOptions":{"weight":1.5,"color":"#222","opacity":0.5},"freezeAtZoom":false},null,null,null,null]},{"method":"addLayersControl","args":[[],"episodes",{"collapsed":true,"autoZIndex":true,"position":"topright"}]}],"limits":{"lat":[18.01,48.15],"lng":[-159.55,-65.78]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->

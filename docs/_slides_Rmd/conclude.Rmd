## Additional Resources

The following cheat sheets and tutorials repeat much of this lesson, but also
provide information on additional functions for "data wrangling".

- [Lubridate Cheat Sheet]
- [Tidyverse Reference on Broom]
- [Purrr Tutorial]
- [Purrr Video]

The first is one of several cheat sheets created by RStudio, and
provides a handy, visual summary of all the key functions discussed in this
lesson. It also lists some of the auxiliary functions that can be used within
each type of expression, e.g. aggregation functions for summarize, "moving
window" functions for mutate, etc.

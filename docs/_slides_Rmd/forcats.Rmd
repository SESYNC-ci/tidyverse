# Embrace factors

`forcats` is for factors. Not to be confused with the `forecast` package.

===

Make the model term column a factor to use `fct_reorder` for sorting.

```{r}
library(forcats)

tidyfit1 %>%
  mutate(term = as_factor(term)) %>%
  mutate(
    term = fct_reorder(term, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, 
                    ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

==

`fct_collapse` to combine factors

```{r}
# example
```

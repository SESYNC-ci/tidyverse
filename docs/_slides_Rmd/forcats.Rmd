# Embrace factors

forcats for factors. not to be confused with forecast.

===

Make the model term column a factor to use `fct_reorder` for sorting.

```{r}
library(forcats)

tidyfit1 %>%
  mutate(term = as_factor(term)) %>%
  mutate(term = fct_reorder(term, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

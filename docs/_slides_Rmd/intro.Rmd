## Lesson Objectives

- Become familiar with opinions of the tidyverse
- Learn functions for tidy import, tranformation, visualization, and modeling
- Combine functionality of multiple tidyverse packages

===

## Specific Achievements
  
- Use `broom` for tidy model output
- Manipulate character data with `stringr`
- Iterate using `purrr`
- Use some less common functions in `dplyr`
- Manipulate dates and times with `lubridate`
- Operate on files using `fs`
- Take charge of factors with `forcats`
- Map point data using `sf` and `leaflet`

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an "opinonated collected of R packages designed for data science." There are multiple packages designed to tackle each stage of the data science workflow (importing, transforming, visualizing, modeling, etc.). All of the packages are unified by common design philosophies and data structures.
